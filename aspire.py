Aspire = """MY SELF-INTRODUCTION.
I am Maikano Jeremiah Befolo from Gombe State Nigeria. Currently 26 years old and a mechanical engineering student at the University of Jos.  I love watching football, playing chess, reading books, and talking to people about their feelings and whatever it is. It shows a high level of agreeableness resonating with people’s emotions and being kind in trying to translate my message to them and assisting them carry out tasks. I love art and visiting art museums is one of my favorite things to do explain my high openness score.
I also love intellectual conservation it helps me build ideology about life and specific topics from other people’s perspectives and thought patterns. I work hard enough to get work done, I seldom postpone projects I have to carry out and I am a very organized person who likes to plan things ahead of time and project how they might turn out this is pegged on the fact that I am high continuousness. I am also good with following orders and for good reason too to set a good example as a leader that discipline and modesty are important. I barely get angry or moody or depressed this is proven by my low score on neuroticism. I am somewhat reserved or low in extroversion but a joy to be around. I love to help and improve people and make them happy. That’s one of the reasons I decided to apply for Aspire and I am truly grateful to have been selected.  one of the few quotes that drive me is the meaning of the Zeno effect - “you can’t change a system while you are watching it.” My strong need to make people happy and impact people’s lives for the better has influenced me to take learning to be an adequate leader seriously. Learning from top scholars who have navigated this process before me and thriving can assist me hone my skills to make a positive impact better and to network and connecting with my peers from diverse cultural backgrounds with similar interests has been a blessing and rare opportunity.
I am savoring this platform and opportunity and making the best use of it.
listening to my some of my peeers presentation on their self- introduction assignment i could gather that we have so many common intrests that align to cause impact. we also all have challenges wwithin us that we are actively working on to make us better carrying out our leadership duties effectively. I loved how much aspire is giving us a platform to express ourselves and figure it out with our peers. I also understand that these group of people are people within my age group and are goal driven and ethutuiastic to put in work."""
